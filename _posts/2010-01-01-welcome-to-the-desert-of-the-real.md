The first meeting was held on September 6, 2024 in the Electrical and Mechanical Building 436.


## Week 1

Introduction

Team members: Siyu Yong, Nan Zhang, Chengping Bi

Supervisor：Zhaogui Wang

Project name：AEROSCOUTS

Slogan：Soaring High, Saving Lives.

## Meeting content
First of all, we had a discussion about the topic of the capstone design with our instructor. We combined the knowledge we learned with our past experience and decided that we wanted to build a drone with visual recognition.

And then we had a discussion about our group name. After discussion, we decided on the group name “AeroScouts”. The name “AeroScouts” is a combination of two elements that are highly relevant to our project. “Aero” is derived from “aeronautics”, which reflects our focus on the field of aviation. Given that our project involves drones, which operate in the airspace, the term “aero” is a perfect fit. “Scouts” was chosen to symbolize our role as explorers and detectors. We are on a mission to discover new things, explore uncharted territories, and gather valuable information.”AeroScouts” represents our group’s identity as a team dedicated to using aviation technology, specifically drones, to act as scouts in the air. And we are committed to exploring, detecting, and providing valuable information through the power of our drones.

And our slogan is:“Soaring High, Saving Lives.” We are longing to contribute to creating pioneers in aerial rescue, dedicated to protecting and serving. Our mission is to conduct non-stop patrols 24/7 and protect those at risk of drowning. Our instructor, Wang Zhaogui, is extremely satisfied with our topic selection and is eagerly anticipating our next progress.

## Project content introduction
Drowning, as one of the most important causes of unintentional injury deaths worldwide, poses a serious threat to adolescents and children. According to statistics, there are about 370,000 people who lose their lives due to drowning every year, and this proportion is particularly prominent in China. In response to this serious problem, our team is developing a drone system specifically designed for water drowning rescue in order to effectively intervene and reduce the number of deaths and injuries in drowning accidents.

The underwater drowning rescue drone system is designed to quickly identify and locate drowning people in open water and deliver life-saving equipment in time. The core technologies of the system include advanced target detection and tracking algorithms YOLOv10 and DeepSort, which ensure efficient target acquisition and continuous tracking. SlowFast video behavior analysis algorithm was integrated to realize the continuous analysis of the movement changes of people on the surface of the water, which significantly enhanced the ability of instant recognition of drowning behavior. Once the system has identified the location of the drowning person, it activates the built-in drop mechanism to automatically release the life buoy or other life-saving material, thereby automating the process from discovery to rescue.

In terms of the control System, the UAV will be developed using the PX4 flight control firmware with the ROS (Robot Operating System) integration platform to ensure the stability and scalability of the system. To adapt to complex rescue environments, the system will employ the EGO-Planner quadcopter trajectory planning algorithm, which helps drones navigate safely and efficiently through dense obstacles or dynamically changing waters. In addition, the drone will be equipped with a variety of sensors, including depth cameras, inertial measurement units (IMU), GPS, to enhance its ability to perceive the environment and ensure accurate judgment and response in any situation.

We expect to complete the development of the entire system within a year and ensure that it can play a critical role in real-world rescue scenarios, while maintaining the reliability and functional integrity of the system.” Through the comprehensive application of this series of technologies, our water drowning rescue UAV system will greatly improve the intelligence level of rescue work, and show strong potential in practical application, providing a powerful technical support program for solving the global drowning rescue problem.
